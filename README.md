This project demonstrates simple neural network computations using Python and NumPy in a Jupyter notebook.

## Contents

- [gen/generative.ipynb](gen/generative.ipynb): Contains two examples of basic neural network forward passes with explanations and code.

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Neuron

- Takes three input values.
- Uses a single neuron with three weights and one bias.
- Applies the ReLU activation function.
- Prints the neuron's output.

### Example 2: Two-Neuron Hidden Layer

- Takes the same three input values.
- Uses a hidden layer with two neurons, each with its own set of weights and bias.
- Applies the ReLU activation function to each neuron's output.
- Prints the outputs of both neurons.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (to run `.ipynb` files)

## Running the Notebook

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy notebook
    ```
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open [gen/generative.ipynb](gen/generative.ipynb) and run the cells.
